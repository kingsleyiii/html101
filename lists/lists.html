    <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
    <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gonna put another list here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you make a list do it in this order:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
            </ol>
            <li>You've got this! I believe in you.</li>
        

        </ul>
    </ol>
